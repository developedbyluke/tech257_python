## What is cloud computing?

- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, allowing for flexible resources and scalability.
- Instead of purchasing computers and software, you rent them over the internet from a cloud service provider.

## 4 Types/Models of Cloud

1. **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone willing to pay.
2. **Private Cloud**: Infrastructure used exclusively by a single business or organisation.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public and private clouds, sharing data and applications between them.
4. **Community Cloud**: Shared by several organisations and supports a specific community.

## Different types of cloud service

**IaaS:** Renting a plot of land to build a house.
**PaaS:** Renting a house framework where you can design the interior.
**SaaS:** Using software over the internet on a subscription basis. It's like renting a furnished house.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing for Businesses

**Advantages:**

- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: No need for upfront investments in hardware and reduces maintenance costs.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Dependence on Internet Connectivity**: Requires a stable and fast internet connection.
- **Limited Control**: Less control over certain aspects of the IT infrastructure.

## OpEx vs CapEx

- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: Spending on services or products now and paying for them over time, as in cloud services. Encourages companies to lease or subscribe to services.
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: Upfront spending on physical infrastructure, with the cost spread over the lifetime of the asset. Traditionally used for on-premises data centres.

## Market share & Trends

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Stands out for its strength in data analytics and machine learning services but also has a very developer friendly PaaS called Firebase, which has a generous free tier appealing to small companies.

## 4 Pillars of DevOps

1. **Collaboration**: Streamlines the development and operations process.
2. **Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks, from code deployment to infrastructure provisioning.
3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Ensures software can be reliably released at any time.
4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Constant monitoring and feedback for continual improvement.

DevOps integrates with cloud computing, using cloud resources for automation, scalability, and flexibility.

**Capital One**: Embraced AWS to innovate faster, reduce costs, and deliver secure banking services.

## Cloud Computing Business Model

- Based on providing scalable and flexible IT resources as a service, billed on a consumption basis.
- Encourages innovation by reducing the barrier to entry for deploying web-scale applications.

## Cloud Costs

- **Compute power**: Charges for virtual machines or serverless compute functions.
- **Storage**: Costs for data storage and data transfer in/out of the cloud.
- **Network**: Charges for data transfer and operational bandwidth.
- **Services**: Costs associated with using higher-level services like databases, machine learning, and application monitoring.
