# level 2
# Use at least one f-string
# Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'

# if time: level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
# Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

# Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
